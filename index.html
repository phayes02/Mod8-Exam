          <h3>Elemental Staffs</h3>
          <p>The staffs consist of two main parts, the Amplification Rod, which is the staff itself, and the elemental stones, which is the crystal appearing in the end of the staffs. Only by combining the two together can the true power of the staffs be revealed. In Origins, parts of the Amplification Rod can be found scattered around the map, and the elemental stones are located in the crazy place.</p>
